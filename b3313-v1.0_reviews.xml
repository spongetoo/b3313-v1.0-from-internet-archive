    <reviewtitle>B3313 TRUE v1.0.1 (April 18th, 2024)</reviewtitle>
    <reviewbody>Hello Kyle, I managed to get the missing B3313 version. Thanks to BikdipOnABus as he was kind enough to send me the lost patch file.

I put it on the Internet Archive:
https://archive.org/details/b3313v1.0.1

Also Chlorobyte has updated all UATweaked patches for official 1.0 and added a troll where the bps patches sometimes change to versions with a corrupted Luigi model.

I don't know all the changes but you can now switch characters in Nighttime Castle Grounds and difficulty scaling Goombas are fixed in every UATweaks patch.</reviewbody>
